Why learn?

* Learn it when you can’t code it 
- Complex tasks where deterministic solution don’t suffice 
- e.g. speech recognition, handwriting recognition 
* Learn it when you can’t scale it 
- Repetitive task needing human-like expertise (e.g. recommendations, spam & fraud detection) 
- Speed, scale of data, number of data points
* Learn it when you need to adapt/personalize 
- e.g., personalized product recommendations, stock predictions
* Learn it when you can’t track it
- e.g., automated driving, fraud detection (input-solution mapping changes dynamically)
